				<h2>TL;DR</h2>

				<p>Each time you put on a dose of Picato, it is if you went out and sat in the sun the entire day and got a moderate to severe sunburn on the treated area. 
				<ol>
					<li>Dose 1 - you get a bad sunburn.</li>
					<li>Dose 2 - your already badly burned skin gets <i>another</i> bad sunburn on top.</li>
					<li>Dose 3 - your now doubly badly burned skin gets <i>a third</i> bad sunburn on top.</li>
			
				</ol>
				
				<p>It looks and feels exactly like this. At the worst, I’d say I reached a pain level 4/10 (common scale used in Hospitals).  Not terrible, but certainly not comfortable.  OK - lets go!</p>

				<h2>My Story</h2>
				<p>I’m 34 yrs old, blond hair, blue eyes - the perfect candidate for sun damage. Right around 33 yrs old I noticed some small red sometimes flaky / crusty spots on my forhead. Sometimes they itched. Some days they looked worse than others. But they were small and not that noticable so I didn’t mind them that much. Here are some pics.</p>

				<h2>Diagnosis</h2>

				<p>During my next annual dermatologist appointment, my dermatologist diagnosed them as mild, early-stage <a href="http://www.skincancer.org/skin-cancer-information/actinic-keratosis">actinic keratosis</a>, a pre-cancerous scaly growth caused by damage from exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation.</p>

				<p>My dermatologist recommended that I use <a href="http://www.picato.com/">Picato</a> (ingenol mebutate) gel, 0.015%, to treat my actinic keratosis. She gave me the “Picato Quick Start Kit” pamphlet that showed some pictures of what to expect, almost identical to the <a href="http://www.picato.com/what-to-expect-with-picato.aspx">“What To Expect” page on the Picato website</a>. </p>
				
				
				<h2>Research</h2>

				<p>When I Google image searched “Picato treatment”,I quickly realized that there are a few different actinic keratosis treatments similar to Picato.  Within Google Image search, images for Picato treatments were mixed in with images from other treatments and it was hard to separate them. I did find one  on <a href="http://www.topicalinfo.org/forum/topic.asp?TOPIC_ID=1132&whichpage=2">decent discussion of Pitaco with some images</a>.  I decided I would document my experience so others can learn from it.</p>

				<h2>Questions I Had During Use</h2>

				<h5>Do I treat a large area or small isolated spots of damaged skin?</h5>  

				<p>As soon as I applied the first dose and felt the burning on my enitre forehead, I thought “oh no! was I supposed to put it on my <i>entire</i> forehead?”.  I could have sworn that is what my dermatologist said, but, for a moment, I doubted myself.  After some Googling, I quickly learned that generally, yes, you treat a whole region; not individual spots. E.g., treat the entire forehead, not five separate 1 cm areas on the forehead.  The idea is that you most likeley have some other damaged skin between so treat all of it.</p>

				<h5>I use aloe vera to help with a sunburn, should I use aloe vera to help with “Picato burn”?</h5>

				<p>My thought is there is at least a 12-hr period between washing off a dose of Picato and re-applying the next dose.  Maybe I could put something on the treatment site in that period that can help?  I called my dermatologist and she said no - do not put anything else on the site.  The risk is that during treatament your skin is hyper sensative and “product x that is supposed to help me” may make things worse.</p>

				<h5>After I finish the last application and wash it off (around hour 72), is there something I can put on my skin to help with the healing process?</h5>

				<p>Some people on the web say they use Aquaphor.  My dermatologist said not to.  But I'm going to call her on Tuesday to inquire again.</p>

				<h5>Ugh, my skin looks <i>horrible</i> (hour 72).  Is this going to heal well?  This is my freaking face we’re talking about!</h5>

				<p>TBD</p>

				<h2>During Treatment</h2>

				<p>I’m going to chronoligically document my experience every 12 hrs below.  The instructions say to apply one tube every 24 hrs, three applications total (there are 48 hrs before the first and last application if you think about it).</p>
